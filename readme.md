<h2>What's this all about?</h2>

Many users who have predominantly used GUI-based data tools, in this case Alteryx, may have a business requirement or just generally be keen to explore code-based equivalents. Due to Python's prevalence, particularly with libraries like pandas, this seemed like a useful resource to put together. Thankfully, Dan had already produced a great asset for anyone switching between Alteryx and T-SQL. This repo uses the exact same examples and produces the same outputs.

<h2>How can I use this?</h2>

1. Navigate to the parent directory you want to store the repository to.
2. Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/DataNath/alteryx_to_python.git`.
3. In the git folder that is created, make a virtual environment with `python -m venv .venv`.
4. Staying in the git root directory, activate your virtual environment with `.venv\scripts\activate`.
5. Install pandas using `pip install pandas`.
6. Run the main script with `python alteryx_to_python.py`.

Note: Steps 3 & 4 aren't essential but spinning up a virtual environment is usually best practice.
