#### What is this?

Many users who have predominantly used GUI-based data tools, in this case Alteryx, may have a business requirement or just generally be keen to explore code-based equivalents. Due to Python's prevalence, particularly with libraries like pandas, this seemed like a useful resource to put together. Thankfully, Dan had already produced a great asset for anyone switching between Alteryx and T-SQL. This repo uses the exact same examples and produces the same outputs.
